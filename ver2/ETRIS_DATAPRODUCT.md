# Data Products for Tsunami Risk Assessment:
<br>The **tsunami data product** in ETRiS provides access to various PTRA components, including **damage scales**, **fragility curves**, **consequence functions**, **vulnerability curves**, and **loss curves**.
#### <br>Each folder in this repository is associated with one of the PTRA components mentioned above.

<br>**Damage scales** The ensemble of mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive damage states (DSi) to describe the whole range of possibilities of damage for an exposed asset (Buildings or other structure). 
<br><br>**Fragility curves** The probability of exceeding a given damage level (DSj) given a certain Intensity Measure (IM).
<br><br>**Consequence functions** The conditional probability distribution (e.g., mean, and standard deviation) of a decision variable DV (e.g., fatalities, economic loss) for prescribed damage states. 
<br><br>**Vulnerability curves** The conditional probability distribution (e.g., mean and standard deviation) of a decision variable DV (e.g., fatalities, economic loss) as a function of the intensity measure IM. 
<br><br>**Loss curves** The mean annual rate of exceeding specific thresholds dv for the decision variable DV.
